White Arrow is a light "Manouvering Cruiser" designed to combat heavy fighters and other light cruisers.  
Armaments feature quad-cannon turret with independent sensor suite on both dorsal and ventral surfaces, supplemented with fixed forward facing beam cannon and missile launchers.  
Defense systems consist of shield generator, heavy hull plating and anti-missile lasers (full coverage).
The ship line is praised for its manouvrability allowing it to outpace much smaller ships in pursuit. 
Against larger oponents, the ship assumes role of "strafer". Angled hull plates aid with deflecting hits and ability to skid sideways allows the ship to keep all weapons pointed at enemy while avoiding return fire.   
Command bridge is situated in center of rotation, to maximize turn capability without relying on inertial dampener systems.  
Ship is equipped with standard hyperdrive for its size, able to keep pace with larger capital ships.  
Major downside of the ship is heat rejection capacity. Engagements at full power tend to overheat the systems quickly, threatening to turn the "White Arrow" into literal molten chunk of steel.

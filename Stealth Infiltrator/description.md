Designed for infiltrating enemy territory and spying on humans.  
This doesn't mean the ship is unarmed. It has a well concealed disintegrator cannon, good for taking out enemies or turning cities into craters.  
Ship is crewed by a pair of robots, because who else can survey you 24h a day without sleeping?  
Equipped with stealth generator and magnetic feet, it could be anywhere.  
Look around, maybe Stealth Infiltrator is spying on you right now?
